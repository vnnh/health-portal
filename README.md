# Problem
1. When doctors have to enter patient notes into electronic health records repeatedly, it takes up valuable time that could be spent working with a patient and leads to physician burnout.
2. When there is a medical emergency, families are often disconnected from their families as medical professionals work to help the patient.

# Solution
1. Automate these administrative tasks so that doctors can simply scan patient information and upload it digitally to a database.
2. Create an app that allows families to be notified when their loved one is in a medical emergency

# Development
